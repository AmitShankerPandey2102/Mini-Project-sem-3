DISASTER RELIEF :-
A community-first web app / resource website to help prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. Designed to be fast, accessible, and usable  when connectivity is limited.
Project overview
This repository contains a Disaster Relief project — a small web application and content repository that helps communities:
provide checklists and preparedness guides,
run quick awareness quizzes and info pages,
offer first-response instructions and recovery resources.

The goal is to ship a lean, offline-capable, and accessible site that local volunteers and affected users can rely on during emergencies.
